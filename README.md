# README
Follow this repo to get a better idea of my skillset. This codebase includes a semi-roll my own MVC, utlizing PHP-DI for
dependency injection. 

The MVC is a bit rough around the edges. Although I have used Laravel and Codeigniter, and tinkered
with others, I have never attempted to assemble one from scratch, for learning purposes.

### Setup

necessary sql files are located in the res directory


To run: **php -S localhost:8000**
