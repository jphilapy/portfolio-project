### Misc
The current assumption of this site is that it will be ran in a subdirectory as in http://localhost/mvc

I could have easily setup a local domain as in portfolio_project.local, the Google API developer's console cannot be configure with such a domain. Google requires it to be mydomain.com or localhost. So, mydomain.local won't work.

Although I am able to work with PHP frameworks such as Laravel and CodeIgniter, which make the development process more efficient, I have chosen to do this project from scratch in order to illustrate my skillset.
